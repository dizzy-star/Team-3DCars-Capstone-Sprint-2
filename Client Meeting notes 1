Dismas Ficklen and Brandon Davis (Team 3D Cars) w/ Prof. Li Meeting Notes
(2/23/23)
Sprint 2

Meeting Times: We will meet bi-weekly on Thursdays, at 10am at W. Liâ€™s office (DH 321). Next meeting is on 3/16. (Delayed due to Spring Break)

Project Goal: The goal for this sprint is to be able to build a 3D scenario from a 2D scenario

  For this sprint, we will be looking over DarraghMac97's "Real-time-Traffic-Simulation-with-3D-Visualisation" code on github. 
    (https://github.com/DarraghMac97/Real-time-Traffic-Simulation-with-3D-Visualisation) 
  And learn how this code operates, and learn how to turn 2D models from SUMO into 3D models from Unity.
